/**
 * @page network_message_norm Network Message Norm Documentation
 *
 * @section overview Overview
 *
 * This document outlines the standard message format utilised by the server 
 * in our network application. The message norm is designed to ensure 
 * consistency, efficiency, and ease of parsing across all network communications.
 *
 * @section message_format Message Format
 *
 * Each message follows a specific structure to maintain uniformity. 
 * The general format is:
 * \verbatim
   element:value-element:value-ip:ip_address
   \endverbatim
 *
 * @subsection components Components
 *
 * - <b>Element</b>: Represents a key in the message. It is a string that describes the type of data.
 * - <b>Value</b>: The value associated with the corresponding element. It can be a string, 
 *   number, or any other data type as per requirement.
 * - <b>IP Address</b>: A special element representing the IP address of the sender or target, 
 *   depending on the context.
 *
 * @subsection separator Separator
 *
 * - Elements and their values are separated by a colon <b>:</b>.
 * - Different key-value pairs are separated by a hyphen <b>-</b>.
 *
 * @section rules Rules
 *
 * 1. <b>Order</b>: The order of key-value pairs in a message is not fixed and can vary.
 * 2. <b>Uniqueness</b>: Each key within a single message must be unique. If a key is repeated, 
 *    the last occurrence is considered valid.
 * 3. <b>IP Address Format</b>: The IP address should follow the standard IPv4 or IPv6 formatting.
 * 4. <b>Special Characters</b>: Avoid using the colon <b>:</b> and hyphen <b>-</b> within keys 
 *    and values, as these are reserved for separating message components.
 *
 * @section example_messages Example Messages
 *
 * 1. <b>Basic Message</b>: 
 *    \verbatim x:0-y:10-hp:40-ip:127.0.0.1:13151 \endverbatim
 *    This message contains three data elements (<b>x</b>, <b>y</b>, <b>hp</b>) and the IP address.
 *
 * 2. <b>Variable Elements</b>: 
 *    \verbatim status:active-id:12345-ip:192.168.1.10:13152 \endverbatim
 *    A different set of data elements showing the flexibility of the message format.
 *
 * @section parsing Parsing
 *
 * Messages should be parsed according to the defined separators. Ensure that the parser is 
 * robust enough to handle variations in the order of elements and the inclusion of different 
 * data types as values.
